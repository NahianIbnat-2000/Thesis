## Overview

This repository contains all data, code, and written chapters for my MA thesis first draft. The content will change as per the Thesis Seminar Comments and Supervisor Comments The study investigates whether daily political climate sentiment influences the **Greenium** — the yield discount on sovereign green bonds relative to maturity-matched conventional twins — in India and Indonesia over 2020–2024.

The empirical design uses a **Twin-Bond quasi-experimental framework** paired with a **staggered Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** estimator, anchored on two political shocks: India's inaugural green bond auction (January 2023) and Indonesia's JETP announcement at the G20 Bali Summit (November 2022). Climate sentiment is measured using **GDELT V2Tone** scores, with a **ClimateBERT** robustness check.

**Key findings:**
- **H1 (Sentiment → Greenium):** Null. Daily climate sentiment does not predict the Greenium in any specification.
- **H2 (Signaling Noise → Greenium):** Significant (p < 0.001). Higher within-day media tone dispersion is associated with a wider, not narrower, Greenium — opposite to the hypothesised Credibility Gap direction.
- **H3 (Political Events → Structural Break):** Null. Neither treatment event produces a significant break, though parallel trends hold in both cases.
- **VIX** is the only robust predictor of daily Greenium movements (β = −0.0035, p < 0.001), pointing to global risk appetite as the dominant driver.

## Data Sources

| Variable | Source | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Sovereign green bond yields | Refinitiv Eikon | Daily |
| Conventional twin bond yields | Refinitiv Eikon | Daily |
| Climate media sentiment (V2Tone) | GDELT Project | Daily |
| ClimateBERT sentiment scores | GDELT + ClimateBERT (Hugging Face) | Daily |
| VIX (volatility index) | FRED | Daily |
| Exchange rates (USD/INR, USD/IDR) | Refinitiv Eikon | Daily |
| Sovereign CDS spreads | Investing.com | Daily |

**Coverage:** January 2020 – December 2024  
**Countries:** India, Indonesia  
**Note:** Thailand was excluded after no tradeable sovereign green bonds with verifiable secondary-market yield data could be identified on Refinitiv.

## Empirical Design

### Twin-Bond Framework
Each sovereign green bond is paired with a **maturity-matched conventional bond** from the same issuer. The Greenium is computed as the daily yield spread between the two (Green Yield − Conventional Yield). For India, two pre-2023 conventional bonds were used to ensure sufficient pre-treatment observations.

### Treatment Events
| Country | Event | Date |
|---|---|---|
| India | Inaugural sovereign green bond auction | January 2023 |
| Indonesia | JETP announcement at G20 Bali Summit | November 2022 |

### Identification Strategy
- **Staggered DiD** with country and time fixed effects
- **Event study** with ±8 weekly leads and lags to test pre-trends and dynamic effects
- **First-differenced** specification as robustness check (Durbin-Watson improved from 0.44 to 2.54)
- **ClimateBERT** as an alternative sentiment measure (54 climate-relevant daily paragraphs identified)

### Key Variables
| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `Greenium` | Daily yield spread (Green − Conventional), in basis points |
| `V2Tone` | GDELT average daily climate media sentiment score |
| `Signaling Noise` | Within-day standard deviation of V2Tone (proxy for credibility gap) |
| `Δlog(VIX)` | Log-differenced CBOE VIX |
| `ΔCDS` | First-differenced sovereign CDS spread |
| `ΔFX` | First-differenced log exchange rate |

## How to Reproduce

1. **Sentiment data:** Run `GreenBond_GDELT_clean.ipynb` and `GreenBond_ClimateBERT_clean.ipynb` on Google Colab to regenerate processed GDELT files.
2. **Panel construction:** Bond yield and control variable data were sourced from Refinitiv, FRED, and Investing.com. Place raw files under `data/raw/` following the existing folder structure.
3. **Regressions:** Run `GreenBond_Regression.ipynb` on Databricks (or a local PySpark/pandas environment) to reproduce all regression tables and coefficient plots.
4. **Event study:** Run `GreenBond_EventStudy.ipynb` to reproduce all event study figures.

All outputs are saved to `output/`.
